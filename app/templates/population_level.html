  <h2>Population Levels Vs. Project Success Rate</h2>
  <div id="pop-chart"></div>
  <br>
  This visualization compares the population levels for each country
  where the World Bank has funded projects, to their success rate. 
  Click on each circle to show a pop up with the country's details.
  The horizontal axis uses a logarithmic scale to allow a better 
  visualization because of the wide range of population levels.
