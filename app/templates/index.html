  <p>This website provides information about the success rate of projects sponsored by the 
    <a href="https://www.worldbank.org">World Bank</a>.  From here, the user can research 
    information about projects at individual countries, and examine several charts that expose
    the correlation between various factors and the rate of success for projects at each country.
    We also provide access to the raw data tables that were used to build the visualizations.
