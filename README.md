# Proposal For Project 2 - UCF Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp 

Data Bootcamp Project2 : Analysis of the World Bank Project Performance Ratings

This document contains our proposal for project 2.  We will produce data visualizations based on the
project assessments carried out by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), an independent unit that
evaluated the performance of projects financed by the World Bank.  Spanning over 30 years, the collection has more than 11,300 project assessments, covering more than 9,600 completed projects; it is perhaps the longest-running and most comprehensive project performance data collection of its kind.

# Data Story
Why are some World Bank project more successefull than other?

We will use data from the [IEG WB Project Ratings](https://data.world/finance/ieg-wb-project-ratings) dataset.

The data is contained in a CSV file, at [IEG_World_Bank_Project_Performance_Ratings.csv]( https://data.world/finance/ieg-wb-project-ratings/file/IEG_World_Bank_Project_Performance_Ratings.csv)
