# Project 2 - UCF Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp 
# Analysis of the World Bank Project Performance Ratings

In this project, we produced data visualizations based on the
project assessments carried out by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), an independent unit that
evaluated the performance of projects financed by the World Bank.  Spanning over 30 years, the collection has more than 11,300 project assessments, covering more than 9,600 completed projects; it is perhaps the longest-running and most comprehensive project performance data collection of its kind.

# Data Story

The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the governments of low- and middle-income countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects.  Their most recently stated goal is the reduction of poverty.

### Why are some World Bank project more successeful than others?

Our work tells the story of the success rate of projects financed by the World Bank Organization, and explore several datasets to try to find why some are successful and others are not. We compared the success rate of projects from data from the [IEG WB Project Ratings](https://data.world/finance/ieg-wb-project-ratings) with other data sets, for example the [Worldwide GDP data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank),  looking for factors that might explain the projects' success rates.  We also uploaded and analyzed data from [world population data set](https://ourworldindata.org/search?q=world+population+by+country) and the [world corruption index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl), and correlated it with the projects' performance data.  

We produced three visualizations that can help predict if a particular project will be successful, and made them accessible in a web application created with the [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) framework. 



The data is contained in a CSV file, at [IEG_World_Bank_Project_Performance_Ratings.csv]( https://data.world/finance/ieg-wb-project-ratings/file/IEG_World_Bank_Project_Performance_Ratings.csv)
